# Assignment 8 - Analog to Digital Converter
Write a program that initializes the ADC14 and then runs in an infinite loop checking for the global flag set by the ADC14 ISR. When the flag is set, it should save the converted value into an array, reset the flag, and start the ADC14 to perform another sample and conversion. After collecting 20 samples from the ADC14, process the array to calculate the minimum, maximum, and average values. (Protip: Use 16-bit variables for saving the samples and 32-bit variables for the calculations to avoid overflow errors)<br /><br />

Print the calibrated voltages (Min, Max, Avg) to a terminal via UART. Remember that the UART can only transmit a single character at a time, so you will have to break down your calculated value into individual digits and transmit them sequentially. Printing to the terminal cannot make use of any stdio.h, stdlib.h, or string.h C library functions for converting numbers to strings. (No itoa(), sprintf() or similar allowed. Sorry. Not sorry.) These values should be printed in units of volts with 2 decimal precision.
