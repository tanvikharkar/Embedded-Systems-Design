# Project 1 - Digital Lockbox
The purpose of this project is to integrate the LCD module and the 12-key keypad to create a virtual electronic lock. Instead of connecting a physical lock mechanism to the microcontroller, the red LED will function as the locking mechanism. When the lockbox is locked, the RGB LED will be red, and when the box is unlocked, the RGB LED will be green.
