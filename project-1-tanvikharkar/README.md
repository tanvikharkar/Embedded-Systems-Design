# Project 1 - Digital Lockbox
The purpose of this project is to integrate the LCD module and the 12-key keypad to create a virtual electronic lock. Instead of connecting a physical lock mechanism to the microcontroller, the red LED will function as the locking mechanism. When the lockbox is locked, the RGB LED will be red, and when the box is unlocked, the RGB LED will be green.<br /><br />
System Requirements:<br />
● The digital lock will utilize a pin number of at least 4 digits.<br />
● The digital lock device will power up in a locked state.<br />
● The LCD will display the status of the lock<br />
● The LCD will display the numbers as the pin is being entered<br />
● When entering the pin, pressing the * key will clear the numbers entered and restart the
entering process<br />
● When the lockbox is locked, the RGB LED will be RED and when the lockbox is unlocked, the
RGB LED will be green<br />
● After unlocking, the lockbox should be able to be relocked without requiring a new pin<br />
● The pin should be reprogrammable when the box is unlocked<br />
● The LCD will utilize both rows of the display
