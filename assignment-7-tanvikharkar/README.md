# Assignment 7 - UART Communications
Write an ISR that echoes whatever is received by transmitting it back to the software terminal. Typing a character in the terminal transmits it rather than causes it to be displayed on the screen. If you want to see what you are typing, the program will need to echo the character it received back to the terminal.<br />
If the character typed is “R” instead of echoing “R”, it should change the text color to red. It should do the same with “B” for blue, “G” for green, and “W” for white.<br /><br />
Verify this works by typing in the terminal and text should appear after “Input: “ in the terminal screen.
